# The assassin game

To add an extra dimension to our team building weekend, we are going to play the assassin game or so called street wars or got'cha.

## Purpose

Be the sole survivor, by _assassinating_ (* not litteraly please) the co-player assigned to you!

## How to assassinate someone?

You were assigned a co-player as a victim and a word as a murder weapon.
*If you can let the co-player say that word, he/she is dead.*

You can not use the murder weapon word in the conversation yourself.

It's OK to have witnesses, it's even better, because then your victim can not deny the assassination.

## How to proceed if I assassinated someone?

You inherit their assigment.

## What if my victim is not here?

Inform Stijn or Marijn, so we can assign you a new victim.
